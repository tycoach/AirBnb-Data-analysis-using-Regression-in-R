Since 2008, Airbnb has helped travelers and hosts find new places to go and offer a more distinctive, personalized way to see the world. Today, Airbnb is a unique service that the entire globe uses and recognizes. For the business, data analysis on the millions of listings offered through Airbnb is essential. These billions of listings generate a ton of data, which can be analyzed and used for a variety of purposes, including security, business decisions, understanding customer and provider (host) behavior and performance on the platform, directing marketing initiatives, putting into practice cutting-edge extra services, and much more.

In this analysis, I provide a thought-provoking analytical topic that can be resolved with the use of the provided dataset. For Airbnb information for New York City.

Do nearby Airbnb listings affect a New York City rental property's price?
